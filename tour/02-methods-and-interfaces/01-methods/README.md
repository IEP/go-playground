# Methods

Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types.

A method is a function with a special _receiver_ argument.

The receiver appears in its owen argument list between the `func` keyword and the method name.

In this example, the `Abs` method has a receiver type of `Vertex` named `v`.
